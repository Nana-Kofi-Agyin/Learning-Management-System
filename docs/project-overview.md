# Project Overview

## What Has Been Built

The project currently contains a working backend service and an empty frontend workspace.

### Backend

- Entry point starts an HTTP server and loads configuration.
- Express app is configured with security and parsing middleware.
- API root and health-check routes are available.
- MongoDB connection is configured and tested on startup.
- Graceful shutdown logic closes the server and DB connection on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.
- Standard error and 404 handlers are implemented.

### Frontend

- `frontend/` exists but currently has no files.

- `backend/src/config/env.js`: Loads `.env` variables and defines defaults.
- `backend/src/config/db.js`: Configures MongoDB connection and readiness checks.
- `backend/src/routes/index.js`: Defines root and health endpoints.
